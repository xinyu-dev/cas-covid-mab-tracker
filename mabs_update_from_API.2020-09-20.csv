new hit from stringent search,NCT04479358,Tocilizumab,Phase 2,"COVID-19's high mortality may be driven by hyperinflammation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) axis therapies may reduce COVID-19 mortality. Retrospective analyses of tocilizumab in severe to critical COVID-19 patients have demonstrated survival advantage and lower likelihood of requiring invasive ventilation following tocilizumab administration. The majority of patients have rapid resolution (i.e., within 24-72 hours following administration) of both clinical and biochemical signs (fever and CRP, respectively) of hyperinflammation with only a single tocilizumab dose.

The investigators hypothesized that a dose of tocilizumab significantly lower than the EMA- and FDA-labeled dose (8mg/kg) as well as the emerging standard of care dose (400mg) may be effective in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation. Advantages to the lower dose of tocilizumab may include lower likelihood of secondary bacterial infections as well as extension of this drug's limited supply. The investigators conducted an adaptive single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT04331795) evaluating clinical and biochemical response to low-dose tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation.

This multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled phase 2 trial -- designed as two sub-studies to allow for the possible emergence of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab 8mg/kg or 400mg -- formally tests the clinical efficacy of low-dose tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia.

Sub-Study A Primary Objective A: To establish whether low-dose tocilizumab reduces the time to clinical recovery in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation, when compared to a tocilizumab-free standard of care.

Hypothesis A: The investigators hypothesize that low-dose tocilizumab, when compared to a tocilizumab-free standard of care, decreases the time to recovery in hospitalized, non-invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation by three days or more.

Sub-Study B Primary Objective B: To establish whether low-dose tocilizumab is near-equivalent to high-dose tocilizumab (400mg or 8 mg/kg) in reducing the time to clinical recovery in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation.

Hypothesis B: The investigators hypothesize that low-dose tocilizumab is near-equivalent to high-dose tocilizumab in reducing the time to clinical recovery in hospitalized, non-invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation."

However, in light of the increased interest on using the anti-cytokine therapy targeting IL-6 tocilizumab in COVID-19 infected patients due to its potential benefit, the Spanish Agency for Medicine and Health Products (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios, AEMPS) have initiated the controlled distribution of the drug. Tocilizumab is indeed proposed as a potential treatment for severe COVID-19 in Spain. Based on the positive results of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and the experience of tocilizumab in inducing rapid reversal of CSS in other pathologies several clinical trials and observational studies are being conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. Further studies with a large sample size are required to confirm the effectiveness of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

The need for the management of severe COVID-19 disease is imperative, and every effort should be made to collect relevant clinical outcomes. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of IV tocilizumab in treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are currently hospitalized or admitted to ICU by describing improvement of respiratory function and mortality rate. This large real-world cohort therefore provides a unique opportunity to study this potential medicine during the current emergency situation, and support the findings from other ongoing clinical trials and observational studies, such as the Roche-sponsored Phase III study that is planned to start early April."

Some patients initially presenting with a non-hypoxemic viral pneumonia (stage 2a) may evolve toward a more severe stage 2b or 3 (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) around the 7th or 10th day of evolution, with a severe biological inflammatory syndrome (CRP>200 mg/l), and some times more severe complications such as acute renal insufficiency, consumptive coagulopathy or shock, requiring increasing oxygen therapy, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and possibly leading to death. This detrimental evolution is due to a host-derived ""cytokine storm"" with a great excess of circulating inflammatory cytokines. In animal models of ARDS complicating coronavirus or influenza virus infection, the cytokine storm has been linked to hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 constitutes an intracellular protein platform which is responsible for caspase1 activation and processing of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 . IL-1b is a major proinflammatory cytokine which induces IL-6, whereas IL-18 is an inducer of interferon gamma (IFNg) production by Th-1 lymphocytes. A blood IL-1/IL-6 signature can be defined by increased neutrophilia and CRP concentrations, whereas an IL-18/IFNg signature is characterized by severe hyperferritinemia, consumptive coagulopathy and cytopenia. A majority of patients with COVID-19 infections seems to have an IL-1/IL-6 signature, evolving in the more severe forms toward an IL-18/IFNg signature, mimicking cytokine profiles observed in other inflammatory diseases such as Still's disease or hemophagocytic syndromes. In Still's disease, therapeutic inhibition of IL-1 or IL-6 has proven to be very efficient strategies. During hemophagocytic syndromes, inhibition of IFNg is effective in humans notably through blockade of its receptor signalization, using the JAK kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib.

Following this strategy, we propose to use biological drugs currently available for inhibition of IL-1 (anakinra), IL-6 (tocilizumab) or IFNg signaling (ruxolitinib) in the severe forms of COVID19-associated disease. Our hypothesis is that IL-1, IL-6 or JAK kinase inhibition will allow:

to prevent stage 2b worsening and the need to be admitted in ICU, by decreasing oxygen-requirement and systemic inflammation
to improve stage 3 and extremely severe stage 3, allowing invasive mechanical ventilation weaning, improving multi-system organ dysfunction, leading to a faster ICU exit.

We propose an open randomized therapeutic trial (1/1/1) on 216 patients with severe stage 2b and 3 of the disease"
new hit from stringent search,NCT04390464,Ravulizumab,Phase 4,"TACTIC-R is a randomised, parallel arm, open-label platform trial for investigating potential treatment for COVID-19 disease. While SARS-CoV infection evades detection by the immune system in the first 24 hours of infection, it ultimately produces a massive immune system response in the subgroup of people who develop severe complications. Most tissue damage following infection with COVID19 appears to be due to a later, exaggerated, host immune response. This leads to lung and sometimes multi-organ damage.

Most people who develop these severe complications still have virus present in their respiratory tract at the time-point when the disease starts to evolve. Immune modulation in the presence of active infection has potential to cause more harm than benefit. Safety considerations when studying immune modulation strategies are paramount. Therefore, this study proposes to assess the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents that target dysregulated immune response that drive the severe lung, and other organ, damage. The medications investigated for efficacy in this trial are Baricitinib and Ravulizumab."

In Pandemics, time is of essence to avoid mortality by intervening early with available evidence, preferably as part of clinical trial.Since the outbreak of corona virus disease (COVID-19), main treatment modalities have been antivirals, interferons, glucocorticoids, anti-coagulants and supportive treatment in addition to traditional Chinese medicine. There are also clinical trials exploring hydroxyquinoline / chloroquine sulphate, azithromycin, immunoglobulins, Vitamin-C, washed microbiota, nebulized interferon, teicoplanin as well as Mesenchymal stem cells. However, most of these trials were small and remain in the experimental phase with currently no effective / speciﬁc antiviral with robust scientific evidence as regards the mortality reduction in COVID-19.In an attempt to treat COVID-19, investigator will use different investigational treatment either alone or in combination to see mortality and morbidity benefit on the basis of limitted evidence available so far. These investigational modalities include Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), Convalescent Plasma (CP), Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in addition to standard supportive treatment."

The study will randomize patients to mavrilimumab or placebo, in addition to standard of care per local practice. The total trial duration will be 12 weeks after single mavrilimumab or placebo dose."
new hit from stringent search,NCT04370834,Tocilizumab,Phase 2,"This phase II expanded access trial will study how well tocilizumab works in reducing the serious symptoms including pneumonitis (severe acute respiratory distress) in patients with cancer and COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 can be associated with an inflammatory response by the immune system which may also cause symptoms of COVID-19 to worsen. This inflammation may be called ""cytokine storm,"" which can cause widespread problems in the body. Tocilizumab is a medicine designed to block the action of a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) that is involved with the immune system and is known to be a key factor for problems with excessive inflammation. Tocilizumab is effective in treating ""cytokine storm"" from a type of cancer immunotherapy and may be effective in reducing the inflammatory response and ""cytokine storm"" seen in severe COVID-19 disease. Treating the inflammation may help to reduce symptoms, improve the ability to breathe without a breathing machine (ventilator), and prevent patients from having more complications."
